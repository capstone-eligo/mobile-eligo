## Setup
1. Follow instructions on [React Native's website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to set up React Native.
2. Clone down repo: `git clone https://github.com/capstone-eligo/mobile-eligo.git`
3. `cd` into `Eligo`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm install --save react-native-router-flux@3.38.0`
6. `react-native run-ios`

## App details
Eligo is built using *React Native* for many reasons - some of which include:
  1. Uses JavaScript (ES6) syntax which is familiar to us for development.
  2. Runs natively (uses native UI) on iOS (and Android) which results in faster and more seamless experience, while allowing us to write in JavaScript.
  3. Ability to develop cross-platform apps with as much source code reuse. Currently only being developed for iOS but the setup for Android would be possible with some modifications.
  4. Large community of developers with extensions that use different elements of the iOS architecture.

Eligo's server-side repo is linked [here](#) and is built with Node JS + Express and deployed on Heroku. Further details can be accessed at the provided repo link.
